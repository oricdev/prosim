            <p>The <a href="http://tuttifrutti.alwaysdata.net/" target="_blank">tuttifrutti</a> is up and running, with no scanning but by entering the barcode so far.</p>

            <p>It makes use of the official OFF-database which requires to compute live similar products
                (roughly based on products’ attributes <em>categories_tags</em> and <em>nutrition_score_uk</em>). The computation of similarities
                is much too long and may take up to 25 seconds for a single request.</p>

            <h4 id="serving-my-needs-and-thats-all-folk">serving my needs… and that’s all folk!</h4>
            <p>Hey, what did you expect :) ?</p>

            <p>As you may have noticed in the second example provided in section <a href="https://oricdev.github.io/prosim/docs/history_tuttifrutti.html">ante-Prosim: the tuttifrutti website</a>, the server is kind enough to deliver (x, y) points for positioning the points in the
                3D.js graph. This is great but not required for all possible needs. Furthermore, this coordinates computation could also be performed on the client-side.</p>

            <h4 id="based-on-my-own-definition-of-good-and-similar">based on my own definition of good and similar</h4>
            <p>What is meant with</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a better product ?</li>
                <li>a similar product ?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Well, as far as I am concerned, and after having looked at the information stored in the OFF-database, I was considering that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>product B is better than product A if the nutrition score of B is better (based on tag <em>nutrition_score_uk</em>)</li>
                <li>similarity of product B with product A : the higher the number of common categories between A and B divided by the number of categories of A, the better!<br />
                    I’m Okay with that! i just need to know about it. It’s like computing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability" target="_blank">probability of the occurrence of an event B knowing the event A</a> or its contrary. It’s not very intuitive but it’s not wrong :). And it is even correct I daresay!</li>
            </ul>

            <p>However, after some discussion with members of the community, it appears that definitions of <i>better</i> and <i>similar</i> may vary:
            a <b>better</b> product could be one with <b>fewer additives</b>, with <b>no allergens</b> at all, <b>gluten-free</b>, or a <b>halal</b> product, depending on own sensitivity, culture, or allergy-susceptibility. Whereas
            </p>

            <p>So the idea is to create and <code class="highlighter-rouge">deliver to the community a product-intersecting backbone</code> which anyone could adapt for matching its own definitions for <b>better</b> and <b>similar</b> products.</p>
