HELLO
            <p>Prosim stands for <strong>PRO</strong>duct <strong>SIM</strong>ilarity.</p>

            <p>The acronym <strong>OFF</strong> used in this documentation stands for <strong>O</strong>pen<strong>F</strong>ood<strong>F</strong>acts.</p>

            <h2 id="goal">goal</h2>
            <p>This project aims at aggregating information
                delivered by the <a href="https://world.openfoodfacts.org">OpenFoodFacts</a> collaborative database in order to deliver more or less similar
                products to a reference product of your choice, classified for instance by their <a href="">nutrition score</a>, but it could be
                enhanced by the community to take into account other criteria rgearding <code class="highlighter-rouge">vegans</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">additives</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">allergens</code>, etc.</p>

            <h3 id="ante-prosim-the-tuttifrutti-website-proof-of-concept">ante-Prosim: the tuttifrutti website (proof-of-concept)</h3>
            <p>I developped a first website <a href="http://tuttifrutti.alwaysdata.net/">tuttifrutti</a> with the idea of getting <em>instantly</em>
                <strong>better products</strong> and pretty similar to the one whose <strong>barcode</strong> I scanned through the
                <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.openfoodfacts.scanner">OFF-App</a>.</p>

            <p>Best would be also to <strong>filter</strong> for the <strong>country</strong> where I am living in, and possibly <strong>shops</strong>
                also in which I am used to do my shopping.</p>

            <p>The website does it all, and you can even query with URL-parameters.</p>

            <p><strong>Try this</strong>, best seen on Firefox dealing with JSON format:</p>

            <p><a href="https://tuttifrutti.alwaysdata.net/fetchAjax/?barcode=29005369&amp;country=en%3Agermany">https://tuttifrutti.alwaysdata.net/fetchAjax/?barcode=29005369&amp;country=en%3Agermany</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://tuttifrutti.alwaysdata.net/fetchAjax/?barcode=3596710024087&amp;country=en%3Afrance&amp;store=auchan">https://tuttifrutti.alwaysdata.net/fetchAjax/?barcode=3596710024087&amp;country=en%3Afrance&amp;store=auchan</a></p>

            <h4 id="up-and-running--but-slow">up and running … but slow</h4>
            <p>The <a href="http://tuttifrutti.alwaysdata.net/">tuttifrutti</a> is up and running, with no scanning but by entering the barcode so far.</p>

            <p>It makes use of the official OFF-database which requires to compute live similar products
                (roughly based on products’ attributes <em>categories_tags</em> and <em>nutrition_score_uk</em>). The computation of similarities
                is much too long and may take up to 25 seconds for a single request.</p>

            <h4 id="serving-my-needs-and-thats-all-folk">serving my needs… and that’s all folk!</h4>
            <p>Hey, what did you expect :) ?</p>

            <p>As you may have noticed in the second example provided in section <em>ante-prosim</em>, the server is kind enough to deliver (x, y) points for positioning the points in the
                3D.js graph. This is great but not required for all possible needs. Furthermore, this coordinates computation could also be performed on the client-side.</p>

            <h4 id="based-on-my-own-definition-of-good-and-similar">based on my own definition of good and similar</h4>
            <p>What is meant with</p>
            <ul>
                <li>a better product ?</li>
                <li>a similar product ?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Well, as far as I am concerned, and after having looked at the information stored in the OFF-database, I consider that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>product B is better than product A if the nutrition score of B is better (based on tag <em>nutrition_score_uk</em>)</li>
                <li>similarity of product B with product A : the higher the number of common categories between A and B divided by the number of categories of A, the better!</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I’m Okay with that! i just need to know about it! It’s like computing the probability of occurrence of event B knowing A or its contrary. It’s not very intuitive but it’s not wrong :).</p>

            <p>circles computed on server , not optimal
                too many computations live on server, not good for a server
                too close to the application, would be better to query/respond immediately</p>

            <p>discussion: what is better product, what is similar, discussion off…
